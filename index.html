        <li>Green vegetables, 200g</li>
        <li>Chili powder, 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, 2 tablespoons</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the green vegetables and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Pour 500g of water into a pot. Once boiling, add the noodles and greens. Cook for <time datetime="PT4M">4 minutes</time>, then drain and serve.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the noodles, then add soy sauce, chili powder, chopped scallions, and minced garlic. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot. Once hot, pour it over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved green vegetables and stir until evenly combined.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
    <p>
        If you prefer a sour and spicy flavor, add 1 spoon of vinegar when seasoning.
        Reducing the cooking time slightly will make the noodles more chewy.
        Serve immediately after preparation, otherwise the noodles will clump together and lose their texture.
